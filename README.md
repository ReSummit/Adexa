# Adexa
An IEEE QP++ Project that aims to replicate the actions of one's arm.

Different sections of project: gyros, flex sensors, servo testing (relaying data to this to control the servos)

Current Progress (5/23/2019):
Flex sensors are working and can make each of the 5 servos move, but no integration in gyros and servos with the flex sensors yet. Will eventually move to attaching components to glove and using solder to connect components.

Past Updates:

(5/23/2019) Issues so far: Need to send a char to run (gyroscope) program, need to unplug and replug USB periodically (for STM32)
